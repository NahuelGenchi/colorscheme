                    <p class="p">When setting out to design a website, a top priority is perfecting your website's color palette. The best way to do this is to look at existing websites and to research competitors, so we've done the leg work for you and compiled a list of 11 website color schemes that work perfectly for each brand.</p>
                    <p class="p">But, hang on a minute. What if you already have a website color palette in mind that you know you want to use? Well, sure, that's a great start but it's important to consider what you want your website color scheme to say before rushing into anything…</p>
                    <h2 class="h2">Considering color psychology for website color schemes</h2>
                    <p class="p">Take the fine artist, Josef Albers. A master of color, he devoted his practice to understanding color and how it affects the onlooker’s mood and adapts into different contexts. A huge part of his research involved looking at the various ways colors interact with each other. Take, for example, his painting below: the combination of dark green and orange feels jarring to look at, whereas in pairing the green with a grey, Albers creates balance with much calmer, contemporary mood for the audience.</p>
                    <p class="p">Findings like his can be used to inform design choices; they’ll help you to choose web design colors to suit your services and accentuate your brand identity for communicating it to consumers.</p>
                    <p class="p">This conversation constitutes an introduction into color psychology, meaning the study of colors and how they affect us on a cerebral level. As Mark Rothko exhibited with his namesake Color Field paintings, certain colors demand certain reactions. So, when we’re considering website color schemes, it’s important to recognise how different tones and hues affect our mood. For example, if we were to design a website for a sustainability charity then we might use shades of green and blue because they invoke feelings of trust, nature and health.</p>
                    <blockquote class="blockquote">“<span>Adopting the perfect color palette for your website establishes a positive perception and consumer.</span>”</blockquote>
                    <p>Not only can you use certain color schemes to influence people’s mood but you can also use it to control how they perceive your website. Exactly why has Facebook always stuck to its blue color scheme? Is it really because Mark Zuckerberg is red-green color blind, meaning blue appears extraordinarily vivid for him? Well, yes, but also because blue is the most universally-loved color. In fact, blue appears in over half of all logos. With that in mind, let’s take a look at the basic psychological principles of all key colors:</p>
                    <ol class="ol">
                        <li><span class="liRed"><strong>Red</strong></span>: speed, energy and passion. Red’s a great color to use when you want your audience to take action. Red is often used for ecommerce website color schemes as well as restaurants and takeaway apps—when you’re hungry and ordering a takeaway, you passionately want your food fast!</li>
                        <li><span class="liOrange"><strong>Orange</strong></span>: optimism and happiness. Orange is universally seen as a “fun” color and using it in your web design is a great way to show you don’t take yourself too seriously.</li>
                        <li><span class="liYellow"><strong>Yellow</strong></span>: warmth, an inviting feeling, positivity. The color of sunshine, yellow is associated with happiness and joy. Super cheerful and accessible. This is a great website color to use for service industries—you’re happy to help!</li>
                        <li><span class="liGreen"><strong>Green</strong></span>: nature and health. Calming and natural, green is the perfect choice for a color scheme when designing for a healthy brand. Green is also a great color choice to convey eco-friendliness and sustainability.</li>
                        <li><span class="liBlue"><strong>Blue</strong></span>: the most versatile and universally liked. Blue has been shown to inspire feelings of trust, making it a heavy favorite in website color schemes.</li>
                        <li><span class="liPurple"><strong>Purple</strong></span>: creativity, wisdom and confidence. Purple is a unique, strong color to use within a website color scheme as it demands attention and stands out.</li>
                        <li><span class="liPink"><strong>Pink</strong></span>: creativity and exuberance. Pink is having the time of its life at the minute, more than ever it’s being embraced by people of all genders and identities, meaning brands are following suit and incorporating it into a range of industries.</li>
                        <li><span class="liBrown"><strong>Brown</strong></span>: wholesomeness, warmth and honesty. When used in web design, brown is a comforting color. It gives websites a natural, down-to-earth vibe and often goes hand in hand with traditional, vintage-inspired designs.</li>
                        <li><span class="liBlack"><strong>Black</strong></span>: modernity, sleek, neutral. Its minimalism is great for luxury websites; many cosmetic brands adopt black as their key color to signify that their product is quality, which possibly helps you justify spending so much..?</li>
                        <li><span class="liWhite"><strong>White</strong></span>: minimalism, transparency. Sometimes the best color choice for minimal web design is no color at all. White is a neutral shade, which means it can easily be combined with other colors for branding purposes. It is primarily used as an accent or background color.</li>
                        <li><span class="liGray"><strong>Gray</strong></span>: maturity, authority. If you’ve got a more serious website, gray is a great color choice, it shows people you mean business.</li>
